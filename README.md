# ImageRecon-PoissonBlending
Image Reconstruction: Implementing image reconstruction using second order derivatives. Image Reconstruction is the process of capturing the shape and appearance of real objects.

Poisson Blending: Poisson blending is a technique in computer vision and image processing that is used to seamlessly combine two images, where the pixels of one image are blended into the pixels of another image. The goal is to create a natural-looking composite image that preserves the colors, lighting, and details of both images.
